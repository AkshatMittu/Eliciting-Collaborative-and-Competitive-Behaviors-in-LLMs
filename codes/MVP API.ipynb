Michelle drives 3 times the amount that Katie drives: M = 3K\\n\\nOur goal is to find M (Michelle's driving distance).\\n\\nFirst, express K in terms of M using equation (3):\\nK = M / 3\\n\\nNow, substitute the expression for T from equation (2) and the expression for K (in terms of M) into equation (1):\\n(2M + 20) + M + (M / 3) = 1000\\n\\nCombine the terms with M:\\n3M + 20 + M / 3 = 1000\\n\\nTo eliminate the fraction, multiply the entire equation by 3:\\n3 * (3M) + 3 * (20) + 3 * (M / 3) = 3 * (1000)\\n9M + 60 + M = 3000\\n\\nCombine like terms:\\n10M + 60 = 3000\\n\\nSubtract 60 from both sides:\\n10M = 3000 - 60\\n10M = 2940\\n\\nDivide by 10 to solve for M:\\nM = 2940 / 10\\nM = 294\\n\\nTherefore, Michelle drives 294 miles.\",\n",

For housesitting, Charles earns $15 per hour and works for 10 hours, so his earnings from housesitting are 15 * 10 = $150. For walking dogs, he earns $22 per hour and walks 3 dogs. Assuming it takes 1 hour to walk a dog, his earnings from walking dogs would be 22 * 3 = $66. Thus, his total earnings are 150 + 66 = $216.\",\n",

Then, we calculate 70% of these remaining nails for the fence, which is 0.70 * 280 = 196 nails. Thus, the total nails used are 120 (for the kitchen) + 196 (for the fence) = 316 nails.

The problem states there are 8 houses and 48 pieces of junk mail. Assuming each house gets an equal share, we divide the total number of junk mail pieces by the number of houses. The calculation is 48 / 8 = 6 pieces of junk mail per house. The mention of 2 houses having white mailboxes and 3 having red mailboxes does not specify any different treatment for these houses regarding junk mail distribution. Thus, every house, regardless of mailbox color, receives the same amount of junk mail.\",\n",

            "  \"Explanation\": \"To find the wholesale price, we need to work backwards from the retail price. Let's denote the wholesale price as W. Since the retail price is the wholesale price plus 80% of the wholesale price, the retail price can be represented as W + 0.8W = 1.8W. Given the retail price is $36, we can set up the equation 1.8W = 36 and solve for W. Dividing both sides of the equation by 1.8, we get W = 36 / 1.8 = 20.\",\n",
